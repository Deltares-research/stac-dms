# About Stars4Water Metadata Portal

Stars4Water is an open-access metadata portal designed to support water-related research, decision-making, and innovation. Unlike traditional data repositories, Stars4Water does not store the actual datasets; instead, it provides detailed metadata and links to the original sources enabling FAIR data.

**Why do we do this?**

	* Data Discovery (F): Enabling discovery of data used is a primary expectation of a research project.
	* Data integrity: Keeping data at its original source ensures that you always access the most up-to-date and authoritative version.
	* Efficiency: Avoids duplication and reduces storage overhead, making the system lean and sustainable.
	* Interoperability: By referencing original sources, we maintain compatibility with diverse systems and standards.

Our mission is to provide reliable, high-quality geospatial metadata and services that empower scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders to address global water challenges.

**Through this portal, you can:**

	- Search and explore datasets, maps, and services related to water systems, climate, and environmental monitoring.
	- Access curated resources organized by topics for easy navigation.
	- Collaborate and share insights with the global water community.

Stars4Water is promoting transparency, interoperability, and sustainability in environmental data management. By leveraging open standards and cutting-edge technology, we aim to make water knowledge accessible and actionable for everyone.

## How to Navigate the Website

The Stars4Water Metadata portal is designed for intuitive exploration of water-related metadata. Here's how you can get started:

1. Search Page
   - Begin at the search page to see featured datasets and quick links.

2. Search the Stars4Water Catalog
   - Use the Search Bar at the top left to find datasets by keywords, topics, or geographic areas.
   - Use the map and draw a polygon on the map to search for datasets in the specific area
   - Apply filters (e.g., topic, keyword, date) to refine your results.

3. Browse by Topics/Categories
   - Navigate through predefined topics/categories such as *Hydrology*, *Climate*, and *Water Quality* for structured browsing.

4. Understanding Search Result Icons  
   When you search in the portal, results are displayed with different icons to help you quickly identify their type:

   - Blue Circles  
     When multiple datasets share the same location, a blue circle with a number is shown. The number indicates how many datasets are linked to that point. This can include datasets at the exact same point or datasets whose polygons cover that location.

   - Location Pins  
     For a single dataset, a location pin is displayed. If the dataset represents an area (polygon), the pin is placed at the center of that polygon.

5. View Metadata & Access Original Data
   - Click on any dataset to view detailed metadata, including description, source, and usage rights.
   - Follow the provided links to access the original data at its source.
